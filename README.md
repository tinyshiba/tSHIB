A decentralised, cute and versatile Meme Token built on Binance Smart Chain.

TinyShiba ($tSHIB) TinyPaper

TinyShiba’s mission is to popularize the peer-to-peer commerce (NFTs) and decentralized finance (DeFi) by using the Shiba Inu hype seen in cryptocurrency and democratize the blockchain by establishing a fair DAO System called ‘Dewoofcracy’.
After a number of Meme Tokens became successful without offering any novelty to the blockchain, our team has decided to change the rules of the game. We are creating a highly versatile and vivid platform which has so many things to offer:

A governance and value accrual token called ‘The TinyShiba Token’ ($tSHIB)
A DAO Platform called ‘Dewoofcracy’
An AMM DEX called ‘WoofSwap’
An IDO Platform called ‘Hooman Launcher’
A DeFi platform with lending, staking and farming called ‘TinyFi’

THE TINYSHIBA TOKEN ($tSHIB)
The TinyShiba Token is the governance and value accrual token for the entire TinyShiba Platform and suite of products. It is identified by the ticker ‘tSHIB’. It will be used for all the platforms that will be explained below.
DECENTRALISED AUTONOMOUS ORGANISATION: ‘DEWOOFCRACY’
The term “decentralized autonomous organization”, also known as DAO, can be described as an open-source blockchain protocol governed by a set of rules, created by its elected members, that automatically execute certain actions without the need for intermediaries.
The DAO’s rules are embedded into computer code, which executes by itself based on the behavior of the protocol. There is no need to interpret these program rules as they are automatically implemented when the specified conditions occur.
Both the program rules and subsequent actions are recorded on a transparent and secure blockchain ledger, which cannot be tampered with thanks to an immutable timestamp and the distribution of the information to the network participants.
Dewoofcracy is the platform for governing TinyShiba and investing in equity and tokens that will be launched on Hooman Launcher. With Dewoofcracy, mainstream investors will have a chance to get involved in venture capital with low-risk. This way, the barriers for ‘tiny’ investors to enjoy cryptocurrency fully will be lifted.

AMM DEX: ‘WoofSwap’
AMM systems took off after they were first implemented by Shearson Lehman Brothers and ATD in the early 1990s — before their invention, order books were created by humans who manually initiated trades meant to enhance the liquidity of the market.
This approach was the reason for some slippage and latency in price discovery on the markets. Furthermore, market makers were also accused of market manipulation. When introduced, AMMs solved all the issues caused by human market makers. Now, these types of systems are also being introduced in blockchain-based decentralized exchanges.
On AMM-based decentralized exchanges, the traditional order book is replaced by liquidity pools that are pre-funded on-chain for both assets of the trading pair. The liquidity is provided by other users who also earn passive income on their deposit through trading fees based on the percentage of the liquidity pool that they provide.
WoofSwap is a decentralized exchange built on Binance Smart Chain, a fast and inexpensive alternative to Ethereum and ERC20 Network. Much like many DeFi AMM protocols running on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain, WoofSwap enables users to swap between cryptocurrency assets by tapping into user-generated liquidity pools. The novelty in WoofSwap is the ultimate intent to popularize DeFi by creating a user-friendly and mainstream platform.

IDO PLATFORM: ‘HOOMAN LAUNCHER’
An initial DEX offering, or IDO, is a new and exciting type of decentralized and permissionless crowdfunding platform, which is opening up a new way of fundraising in the crypto space.
An IDO refers to a project launching a coin or token via a decentralized liquidity exchange. This is a type of crypto asset exchange that depends on liquidity pools where traders can swap tokens, including crypto coins and stablecoins. For instance, USDT/ETH is a liquidity pair.
IDOs are the successor of other crypto fundraising models, including initial coin offerings (ICOs), security token offerings (STOs) and initial exchange offerings (IEOs). Offering better and immediate liquidity at every price level due to its mechanics, IDOs are an excellent choice for new projects and startups keen to launch a token and access immediate funds.
Unlike the aforementioned fundraising methods, IDOs are generally considered a fair way to launch a new cryptocurrency project by avoiding pre-mines, which is an issuance system that favors project founders over community members
In the year 1957, our dearest friend dogstranaut Laika was launched to the space by the Hoomans of USSR. That’s why we dedicate our work to the famous dogstranaut Laika and vowing to launch the hoomans to the space with our Hooman Launcher, which is a new IDO Platform that will be built on Binance Smart Chain. While it will be decentralised, we strongly will encourage Meme Tokens, NFT Projects and DeFi Projects to launch their projects on Hooman Launcher.

DEFI PLATFORM: ‘TINYFI’
Short for decentralized finance, DeFi is an umbrella term for a variety of applications and projects in the public blockchain space geared toward disrupting the traditional finance world. Inspired by blockchain technology, DeFi is referred to as financial applications built on blockchain technologies, typically using smart contracts. Smart contracts are automated enforceable agreements that do not need intermediaries to execute and can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection.
DeFi consists of applications and peer-to-peer protocols developed on decentralized blockchain networks that require no access rights for easy lending, borrowing, or trading of financial tools. Most DeFi applications today are built using the Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain network, but many alternative public networks are emerging that deliver superior speed, scalability, security, and lower costs.
TinyFi is a set of protocols working in conjunction on the Binance Smart Chain blockchain that allow users to maximize their passive earnings on crypto assets that they own, through the use of lending and trading services. Do not tie your TinyShiba to trees and posts, tie them here!

Conclusion
With a renewed focus and mission to bring cuteness to blockchain, especially on NFT, IDO, DeFi and DAO Platforms, as well as an AMM DEX called WoofSwap, we believe we are better positioned than ever before to unlock multiple billion dollar opportunities for the fans of Shiba Inu and Memes. While we are attracting the users that already have basic understandings of cryptocurrency that already number in the millions, we will also target the mainstream users with using the popular culture objects such as Shiba and Memes. Ultimately, the mainstream users will be attracted to the DeFi concept and they will feel confident with the effect of the user-friendly interface and cuteness of their favorite memes.
